# CRUD PROJECT WITH AJAX (V2.0)

## WHAT IS THIS?
A little project that shows how to use AJAX, MySql and PHP to administrate and create basic functions like 
sign up and log in users. In the same way, you can submit tasks on a web and administrate those:

- [x] CREATE
- [x] READ
- [x] UPDATE
- [x] DELETE

## WOULD YOU LIKE TEST THIS?
Just use MYSQL as DATA BASE, you have to execute 'CrudBd.sql' in 'app\config\CrudBd.sql'
